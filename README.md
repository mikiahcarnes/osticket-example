  <h2>Steps</h2>
<p>
<h3 align="center">If you followed the previous steps, osTicket is installed and configured. We will now go through the process of creating a ticket as a customer/user and then solving the ticket as an agent. Copy this and paste it, and it will take you to the Support Center home page http://localhost/osticket/upload/</h3>

</p>
<p>
<h3 align="center">From the home support center page, you will have the option to open a new ticket or check the ticket status. Click on open a new ticket, which looks like the image above, and create a new ticket with whatever help topic you created earlier. Give a brief description of the issue and click Create Ticket. <a href="https://docs.osticket.com/en/latest/User/Ticket/Open%20A%20Ticket.html" target="_blank"> Documentation</a></h3>

</p>
<br />
<br />
<h3 align="center">Now, go to this page http://localhost/osticket/upload/login.php and click on sign in here next to I'm an agent. Sign in as one of the agents you created earlier and click on the Tickets tab, where you'll see the ticket you created earlier. Click on the ticket, and you will see the ticket dashboard. You can change the Priority and SLA Plan of the ticket. You should also assign it to yourself. You can go through and play around with the whole interaction as I did in the picture above, and when you are done, click on the Ticket Status dropdown at the bottom of the ticket and click Resolved.</h3>

<h3 align="center">After you resolve the ticket and return to the Ticket tab, you will see that it is now in the closed tab. Congratulations! You have now installed, configured, and used osTicket.</h3>
